# Z80 Emulator Project
**CMSC 411: Computer Architecture â€“ Fall 2024**  
**Author: Talha Waseem**  
**Professor: Dr. Sebald**

This project implements a Z80 microprocessor emulator in C++, replicating key functionalities of the Z80 CPU.

## Project Features
- **Core Instruction Set**: Supports key Z80 operations.
- **Special Prefixes**: Handles `CB`, `DD`, `FD`, and `ED` instructions.
- **Memory Emulation**: Includes 64KB RAM emulation.

## Compilation
To compile the project, use:
```bash
g++ -o z80_emulator z80_emulator.cpp
```

## Execution
To test the code, use:
```bash
./z80_emulator <file>.bin
```

## Testing
This project was tested using the .bin files provided by the professor. They've been included in the 'Testing' directory.
